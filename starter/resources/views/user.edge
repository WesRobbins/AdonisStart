  <h1>User Documentation</h1>

  <h2>SpecialProject.io Commenting API (v1.0 beta) </h2>
  <body>
    <br>
    <p> <b>Summary:</b>The goal of the API is a commenting interface for SpecialProjects's site where their
      users can comment, reply, like, etc. content on there site. The commenting API will use
      SpecialProject's UUIDs' (universally unique identifier) to identify the users and their
      required information. The API should work similarly to the reddit commenting interface
      with nested comment replys.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The data such as the comments and the users linked to them will be stored on a live database
      provided by MSU. MSU will also host the live API URL.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Main page URL:</b> http://esof423.cs.montana.edu:4013
    <p>
      <br>
      Postman will be used as the API devlepement tool for reqeusts
      to and and from the API to the SpecialProject site.
      <br>
      <br>

      <b>SpecialProject will use the provdided URL's to call different functions:</b>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Add Comment:</b> http://esof423.cs.montana.edu:4013/add</li>
              <p class="tab"> By using the above link the user will be able to
                  successfully add a comment to the database, with the option to edit
                  their post. Once the post has been added, users will be able to
                  checkout comments by adding /edit/post id number to the existing URL through
                  which is accessed by a post request</p>
        <li><b>Upvote:</b> http://esof423.cs.montana.edu:4013/upvote</li>
              <p class="tab">The comment rating can be increased by using the above URL
                  by including the post id number in the form /post id. Once the
                  link has been entered and run, the comments rating will then be updated
                  through a get request and be visible with the comment.</p>
        <li><b>Downvote:</b> http://esof423.cs.montana.edu:4013/downvote</li>
              <p class="tab">The comment rating can be reduced by using the above URL
                  by including the post id number in the form /post id. Once the
                  link has been entered and run, the comments rating will then be updated
                  through a get request and be visible with the comment.</p>
        <li><b>Delete Comment:</b> http://esof423.cs.montana.edu:4013/delete</li>
              <p class="tab">Deleting the comment will work similar to the voting system
              through get requests when using the URL above with the /post id extension
              added. </p>
      </ul>
